# 3
# A What type of error have been checked for?
# We have checked for missing age, missing fare, missing home dest, missing embarked and finally removed high missing values which includes "boat", "body" and "cabin"

# B Has this type of error been found?
# Yes. All of the errors have been found and fixed.

# C If it has been found, how has it been recovered?
# The missing age has been changed to average age. Missing fare to average fare. Missing destination changed to 'NA'. Missing embarked changed to 'S'. The data from the last 3 columns have been removed

# D do you suggest any other alternative way of data reparation?
# The missing values for age and fare could be changed to 0 instead of average.
